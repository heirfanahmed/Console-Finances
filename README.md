# Console-Finances

## Description

### Action

    1. Created a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances` and cloned it to my local computer.

    2. Copied the week-4 challenge starter files in my local git repository and then pushed it to GitHub.

    3. Dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses has been given in the index.js file.

    4. Wrote JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

        * The total number of months included in the dataset.

        * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

        * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  
            * I need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
            * (`Total/Number of months`)

        * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

        * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

    5. When I open my code in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
            
            Financial Analysis
            ----------------------------
            Total Months: 25
            Total: $2561231
            Average  Change: $-2315.12
            Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
            Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
            ```

    6.  Final code is prints the analysis to the console.

    **Hints:**

    * I did some research on my own for this project!

    * In order to combine strings and variables in the console I used **concatenation**.

    * I printed to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
